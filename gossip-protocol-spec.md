# Gossip protocol

Solana nodes communicate with each other and share data using the gossip protocol. They send messages in a binary form which need to be deserialized. There are 6 types of messages:
* pull request
* pull response
* push message
* prune message
* ping
* pong

Each message contains data specific to its type: values that nodes share between them, filters, pruned nodes, etc. Nodes keep their data in _Cluster Replicated Data Store_ (`crds`), which is synchronized between nodes via pull requests, push messages and pull responses.

## Message format

Each message is sent in a binary form with a maximum size of 1232 bytes (1280 is a minimum `IPv6 TPU`, 40 bytes is the size of `IPv6` header and 8 bytes is the size of the fragment header). 


Data sent in the message is serialized from a `Protocol` type, which can be one of:

| Message                        | Data                      | Description |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| [pull request](#pullrequest)   | `CrdsFilter`, `CrdsValue` | sent by node to ask for new information |
| [pull response](#pullresponse) | `Pubkey`, `CrdsValuesList`   | response to a pull request |
| [push message](#pushmessage)   | `Pubkey`, `CrdsValuesList`     | sent by node to share its data |
| [prune message](#prunemessage) | `Pubkey`, `PruneData`     | sent to peers with a list of nodes which should be pruned |
| [ping message](#pingmessage)   | `Ping`                    | a ping message |
| [pong message](#pongmessage)   | `Pong`                    | response to a ping |

### Type definitions
Fields described in the tables below have their types specified using Rust notation:
* `u8` - 1 byte of unsigned data (8-bit unsigned integer)
* `u16` - 16-bit unsigned integer
* `u32` - 32-bit unsigned integer, and so on...
* `[u8]` - dynamic size array of 1-byte elements
* `[u8; 32]` - fixed size array of 32 elements, with each element being 1 byte
* `[[u8; 64]]` - a two-dimensional array containing arrays of 64 1-byte elements 
* `MyStruct` - a complex type (either defined as a struct or a Rust enum), consisting of many elements of different basic types

The **Size** column in tables contains the size of data in bytes. The size of dynamic arrays contains an additional _plus_ (`+`) sign, e.g. `32+`, which means the array has at least 32 bytes. Empty dynamic arrays always have 8 bytes which is the size of the array header containing array length. 
In case the size of a particular complex data is unknown it is marked with `?`. The limit, however, is always 1232 bytes for the whole data packet (payload within the UDP packet).

#### Data serialization
In the Rust implementation of the Solana node, the data is serialized into a binary form using a [`bincode` crate][bincode] as follows:
* basic types, e.g. `u8`, `u16`, `u64`, etc. - are serialized as they are present in the memory, e.g. `u8` type is serialized as 1 byte, `u16` as 2 bytes, and so on,
* array elements are serialized as above, e.g. `[u8; 32]` array is serialized as 32 bytes, `[u16; 32]` will be 64 bytes,
* dynamically sized arrays have always an 8-byte header containing array length plus bytes of data, therefore empty arrays take 8 bytes,
* [enum types](#enum-types) contain a header with a 4-byte discriminant (tells which enum variant is selected) + additional data
* struct fields are serialized one by one using the rules above.

##### Enum types
Enum types in Rust are more advanced than in other languages. Apart from _classic_ enum types, e.g.:
```rust
enum CompressionType {
    Gzip,
    Bzip2
}
```
it is also possible to create an enum which contains data fields, e.g.:
```rust
enum SomeEnum {
    Variant1(u64),
    Variant2(SomeType)
}

struct SomeType {
    x: u32,
    y: u16,
}
```
In the first case, the serialized object of `CompressionType` enum will only contain a 4-byte header with the discriminant value set to the selected variant (`0 = GZip`, `1 = Bzip2`). In the latter case apart from the header the serialized data will contain additional bytes according to which variant was selected: 
* `Variant1`: 8 bytes
* `Variant2`: 6 bytes (the sum of `x` and `y` fields of `SomeType` struct)

Special care needs to be taken when deserializing such enum as according to the selected variant number of following data bytes may be different.


### Gossip loop

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  A(Send push requests: Version, NodeInstance) --> C(Generate push messages)
  subgraph Gossip loop
  C --> D(Generate pull requests)
  D --> E(Generate ping messages)
  E --> F(Send generated messages)
  end
  F --> a1
  subgraph Every 7500ms
  a1(Send push requests: Version, ContactInfo, LegacyContactInfo) --> a2(Refresh active set of nodes)
  end
  a2 --> C
```

Each node runs a gossip loop where in each iteration the following actions are performed:
* just before the loop starts node sends a push message containing `Version` and `NodeInstance`
* [push messages](#pushmessage), [pull requests](#pullrequest) and ping messages are generated and sent
* values older than the `active_timeout` are purged from `crds`
* old failed inserts are also purged (these are pull responses that failed to be inserted into `crds` - they are preserved to stop the sender from sending back the same outdated payload by adding them to the filter for the next pull request)
* every 7500ms node sends a push request containing `LegacyContactInfo`, `ContactInfo` and `NodeInstance` and refreshes its active set of nodes

### PushMessage
It is sent by nodes who want to share information with others:
* node gathers entries from `crds` with timestamps inside the current wallclock window (+/- 30s)
* creates push messages that will be sent to peers from the active set
* pruned nodes are excluded unless entry should be pushed to the prunes too.

The above actions are performed periodically inside the [gossip loop](#gossip-loop). 

A node receiving the message checks for:
* duplication - duplicated messages are dropped. The node responds with a prune message periodically based on the node's stake, inbound peer stake, and timeliness of the peer node
* new data:
    * new information is stored in `crds` and replaces the old value
    * duplicates are tracked in `ReceivedCache`
    * retransmits information to its peers, which are randomly selected such that they have not pruned source addresses of the messages
* expiration - messages are dropped when older than `PUSH_MSG_TIMEOUT` and when `crds` table fills up.

| Data | Type | Size | Description |
|------|:----:|:----:|-------------|
| `Pubkey` | `[u8; 32]` | 32 | a public key of the origin |
| `CrdsValuesList` | [`[CrdsValue]`](#data-shared-between-nodes) | 8+ | a list of values to share  |


### PullRequest
A node sends it to ask the cluster for new information. Inside the [gossip loop](#gossip-loop) node does the following each iteration:
* collects a list of peers based on their stake (only the highest staked nodes are collected)
* creates bloom filters from `crds` values, purged values, and failed inserts - these are things the node already contains
* divides filters randomly among peers using weights calculated from their stakes - weights are calculated based on the time since last picked and the natural log of the stake weight
* adds a `LegacyContactInfo` value to each pull request which contains its ports and addresses
* created and sends pull requests to peers.

Nodes receiving pull requests:
* filter and insert pull request values into their `crds`
* gather all new values from their `crds`
* filter them using the provided filters
* send `PullResponse` to the origin of the request.

| Data | Type | Size | Description |
|------|:----:|:----:|-------------|
| `CrdsFilter` | [`CrdsFilter`](#crdsfilter) | 37+ | a bloom filter representing things node already has |
| `CrdsValue` | [`CrdsValue`](#data-shared-between-nodes) | ? | a value, usually a `LegacyContactInfo` of the node that sends the pull request containing node socket addresses for different protocols (gossip, tvu, tpu, rpc, etc.) |

#### CrdsFilter

| Data | Type | Size | Description |
|------|:----:|:----:|-------------|
| `filter` | [`Bloom`](#bloom) | 24+ | a bloom filter |

struct Bloom {
    keys: Vec<u64>,
    bits: BitVec<u64>,
    num_bits_set: u64,
}
```

</details>

### PullResponse
These are sent in response to a `PullRequest`. They contain filtered values from node `crds`. 

Pull responses are processed by recipients according to the responses' timestamps:
* responses that don't exist in the nodes `crds` or exist and have newer timestamps are inserted into `crds`, their owners `LegacyContactInfo` timestamps are updated in `crds`
* responses with expired timestamps are also inserted, but without updating owner timestamps
* hashes of outdated values that were not inserted into `crds` (value with newer timestamp already exists, or value owner is not present in `crds`) are stored for future as `failed_inserts` to prevent peers from sending them back

| Data | Type | Size | Description |
|------|:----:|:----:|-------------|
