# Gossip protocol

This document describes the gossip protocol without implementation details which can be found [here](/implementation-details.md).

Solana nodes communicate with each other and share data using the gossip protocol. They send messages in a binary form which each node need to deserialize. There are 6 types of messages specified:
* pull request
* pull response
* push message
* prune message
* ping
* pong

Each message contains data specific to its type: values that nodes share between them, filters, pruned nodes, etc. Nodes keep their data in _Cluster Replicated Data Store_ (`crds`) which is synchronized between them via pull requests, push messages and pull responses.

### Message format

Each message is sent in a binary form with a maximum size of 1232 bytes (1280 is a minimum `IPv6 TPU`, 40 bytes is the size of `IPv6` header and 8 bytes is the size of the fragment header). Apart from the data byte array packet contains additional metadata:

 * size - size of the packet
 * addr - address of the origin
 * port - port of the origin
 * flags - additional flags

```rust
struct Packet {
    buffer: [u8; 1232],
    meta: Meta,
}

struct Meta {
    pub size: usize,
    pub addr: IpAddr,
    pub port: u16,
    pub flags: PacketFlags,
}

struct PacketFlags: u8 {
    const DISCARD        = 0b0000_0001;
    const FORWARDED      = 0b0000_0010;
    const REPAIR         = 0b0000_0100;
    const SIMPLE_VOTE_TX = 0b0000_1000;
    const TRACER_PACKET  = 0b0001_0000;
    const ROUND_COMPUTE_UNIT_PRICE = 0b0010_0000;
}
```

#### `Protocol`

Data sent in the message is serialized from a type:
``` rust
enum Protocol {
  PullRequest(CrdsFilter, CrdsValue),
  PullResponse(Pubkey, Vec<CrdsValue>),
  PushMessage(Pubkey, Vec<CrdsValue>),
  PruneMessage(Pubkey, PruneData),
  PingMessage(Ping),
  PongMessage(Pong)
}
```

where:
* `PullRequest` - is sent by node to ask the cluster for new information, contains two values:
  * `CrdsFilter` - a bloom filter representing things node already has
  * `CrdsValue` - a [value](#crdsvalue), usually a `LegacyContactInfo` of the node who send the pull request containing nodes socket addresses for different protocols (gossip, tvu, tpu, rpc, etc.)
* `PullResponse` - these are sent in response to `PullRequest` and contain:
  * `Pubkey` - a public key of the origin
  * `Vec<CrdsValue>` - a list of new values 
* `PushMessage` - it is sent by nodes who want to share information with others. They contain:
  *  `Pubkey` - a public key of the origin
  * `Vec<CrdsValue>` - list of values to share
   <!-- Node receiving the message checks for:
    - duplication - duplicated messages are dropped, node response with prune message if message came from low staked node
    - new data:
        - new information is stored in `crds` and replaces old value
        - stores message in `pushed_once` which is used for detecting duplicates
        - retransmits information to its peers
    - expiration - messages older than `PUSH_MSG_TIMEOUT` are dropped -->
* `PruneMessage` - it is sent to peers with a list of nodes that should be pruned
  * `Pubkey` - a public key of the origin
  * `PruneData` - contains a [list of pruned nodes](#prunedata)
* `PingMessage` - nodes are sending [ping](#ping) messages from time to time to other nodes to check whether they are active. `PingMessage` contains a 32 bytes token generated by the origin.
* `PongMessage` - sent by node as a [response](#pong) to `PingMessage` - contains public key of sending node, its signature and hash of the token sent in `PingMessage`.
